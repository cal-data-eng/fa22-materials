    "# Project 2: Query Performance\n",
    "## Due Date: Friday 10/07, 11:59 PM\n",
    "## Assignment Details\n",
    "In this project, we will explore how the database system optimizes query execution and how users can futher tune the performance of their queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project works with the Lahman's Baseball Database, an open source collection of baseball statistics from 1871 to 2020. It contains a variety of data, like batting statistics, team stats, managerial records, Hall of Fame records, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If at any point during the project, the internal state of the database or its tables have been modified in an undesirable way (i.e. a modification not resulting from the instructions of a question), restart your kernel and clear output and simply re-run the notebook as normal. This will shutdown you current connection to the database, which will prevent the issue of multiple connections to the database at any given point, and when re-running the notebook you will create a fresh database based on the provided Postgres dump.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics & Scoring Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "For Data 101 students, this project is worth 15% of your grade. For Info 258 students, this project is worth 12% of your grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each coding question has **both public tests and hidden tests**. Roughly 50% of your coding grade will be made up of your score on the public tests released to you, while the remaining 50% will be made up of unreleased hidden tests.\n",
    "- Public tests for multiple choice questions are for sanity check only (e.g. you are answering in the correct format). Partial credit will be awarded.\n",
    "- Free-response questions will be manually graded. Please answer thoughtfully in complete sentences, drawing from knowledge in lectures and from your inspection of query plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **individual project**. However, you’re welcome to collaborate with any other student in the class as long as it’s within the academic honesty guidelines.\n",
